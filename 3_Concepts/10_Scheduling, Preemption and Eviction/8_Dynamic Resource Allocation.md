Dynamic resource allocation is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and containers inside a pod. It is a generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources. Third-party resource drivers are responsible for tracking and allocating resources, with additional support provided by Kubernetes via structured parameters (introduced in Kubernetes 1.30). When a driver uses structured parameters, Kubernetes handles scheduling and resource allocation without having to communicate with the driver. Different kinds of resources support arbitrary parameters for defining requirements and initialization.
